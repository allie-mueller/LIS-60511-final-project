      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Books Unlimited began as a cozy independent bookstore tucked away on a corner in New York City. Founded by a family of lifelong readers, it quickly became a gathering place for locals to discover new stories, share recommendations, and celebrate the written word. What started as a single shop with shelves stacked high and a personal touch soon grew into a beloved name across the Tri-State area.

        Even as we’ve expanded to several locations and launched our online store, Books Unlimited has stayed true to its roots. We remain a family-owned business devoted to community, conversation, and the joy of reading. Every store—whether you visit in person or online—carries the same spirit that defined our very first shop: a love of books, and a belief that there’s always another great story waiting to be found.
